## Introduction

This is my own template using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/), [DaisyUI](https://daisyui.com/) and [Next-Themes](https://github.com/pacocoursey/next-themes).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to see the result.

Edit `src/app/(navbar)/page.tsx` and save to reload. Currently there are two pages: `Home` and `Dashboard`. Edit anything you want to build your own project.

## Theming

This template is using [Next-Themes](https://github.com/pacocoursey/next-themes). `ThemeToggler` is located in `src/components`. You can change the theme by clicking the button. Light and dark themes are already set up by [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) and [DaisyUI](https://daisyui.com/).

- Notice: DaisyUI is a pure CSS component library
